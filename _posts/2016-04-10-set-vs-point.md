title: "Set Based vs Point Based Communication"
---
Communicating effectively can mean the difference between a 30 second conversation and eight 30 second conversations. When you remember the impact that task switching can have on your work, those eight conversations may have cost you a lot of time.

The situation used below is familiar to anyone who's ever had to hold a meeting. It may have benefits in other situations.

Compare the following two conversations:
### Conversation 1 -
Adam: Hey Betty, are you free for a meeting at 12?  
Betty: Sorry Adam, nope.  
Adam: How's 2?  
Betty: Nope, 2 doesn't work either. I am free at 4.  
Adam: Nup, 4 doesn't work for me. I'm free right now though. Does that work?  
Betty: Sorry, I missed your email. That would have been perfect. How's 8:30 tomorrow?  
Adam: Erm, 8:45 works.  
Betty: Excellent. See you then.

This is an example of point based communication. Each message communicates approximately one point.
 
### Conversation 2 -
Adam: Hey Betty, I want to meet to talk for about 30m about project X.  
I'm free at 12, 2 and 3 today, or 8:45 to 10 tomorrow.  
Betty: Let's do 3 today.

This is an example of set based communication. Each message communicates a set of options.

Set based communication is usually better than point based communication.

(I'm sure I once came across this point made by someone else on the Internet, but in at least three years of occasional searching I've not managed to re-find it.)
