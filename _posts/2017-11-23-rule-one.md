**Rule:** On the Internet, don't vaguely describe something when you could include a link.

Don't provide unlinked text saying "on our customer support page", link the text to your customer support page. Don't refer vaguely to "the configuration page in our CMS", link to the configuration page in your CMS.

Things that count as "on the Internet" (for the purposes of this rule; yes, I know): emails, web pages (wiki pages, intranet pages, …), support tickets, tracker stories, task tracker tasks, IM messages, …

**Corollary to the rule:** On the Internet, make it linkable
Any web page with content people may wish to link to should be linkable, and any page longer than a few sentences should be deep linkable - include `id` attributes on relevant html tags so that people can link to those parts of the page (`https://example.com/article.htm#chapter4`).
